Dr Williams’ Fellowship is to use laser cooled molecules trapped in precisely controlled arrays to study the interaction of the molecules to simulate real world systems in a quantum simulator. This work forms part of the rapidly expanding area of quantum technology and computing and will lay the foundations of an entirely new way to study highly complex systems ranging from matter on earth through to the Universe.
