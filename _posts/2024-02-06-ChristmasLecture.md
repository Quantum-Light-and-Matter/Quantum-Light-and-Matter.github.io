In December 2023 QLM members Steven Wrathmall and Ifan Hughes gave the Physics Department’s Christmas [lectures](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/major-lecture-series/xmas-lectures/).
400 local school children came to see the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvYxLrImEP4) entitled “Decoding the Spectrum: Saving Civilisation from Solar Storms”.
Dani Pizzey helped plan the talk and prepare the demonstrations.

Solar flares pose a serious threat to modern-day civilisation. Space weather forecasting helps us to limit the potentially catastrophic damage caused by such events. We need a way to measure the magnetic field of the Sun from a distance of 93 million miles. In the lecture Steve and Ifan  explained how we have learned about most of the Universe – by decoding the information in the radiation arriving at Earth.
Research done in  QLM to realise the narrowest atomic filters was highlighted, in addition to building a solar telescope with our colleagues form the Centre For Advanced Instrumentation (CFAI).
