## Electromagnetic Induction Imaging with Atomic Magnetometers

Atomic Magnetometers are a promising candidate to succeed the induction coil as the sensor for electromagnetic induction imaging (EMI), a non-destructive tomographic technique that can map material conductivity and reveal sub-surface structures. While laboratory experiments have demonstrated the ability to leverage extreme sensitivity (below femto-Tesla/sqrt(Hz)) at kHz frequencies, atomic magnetometers face several hurdles to real-world EMI. This talk will focus on several experimental setups that address the issues of background magnetic noise, imaging speed and spatial resolution.
