## The role of quantum chaos in ultracold molecular collisions

Ultracold molecules hold immense potential to revolutionise many fields from precision metrology to quantum information science. But unlocking these possibilities hinges on our ability to understand and control the collisions of ultracold molecules. In this talk I will discuss my work to understand the role of quantum chaos in these processes, and explain how these concepts can serve as a powerful tool for understanding and modelling ultracold molecular collisions.
