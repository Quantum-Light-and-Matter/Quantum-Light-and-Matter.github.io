## Thomas Wall (RAL Space)

## Phononic Frequency Combs

The RAL Space Spectroscopy Group (SG) undertakes R&D in instrument development for a range of gas sensing applications, primarily in atmospheric measurements, but also in medical diagnosis, monitoring of industrial processes, fundamental spectroscopy and space science. I will give an introduction to the SG and an overview of some recent project. I will then focus on a recently developed instrument that uses open-path laser dispersion spectroscopy for measuring atmospheric methane.
