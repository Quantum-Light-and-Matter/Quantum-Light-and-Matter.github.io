## Many-Body Quantum Chaos and Spectral Form Factor

The study of spectral statistics is of importance in physics due to its simplicity, universality, and utility as a diagnosis of quantum chaos and localization. Recently, as a probe of spectral statistics, the spectral form factor (SFF) has been instrumental in pinpointing novel signatures of many-body quantum chaos, in demonstrating the random matrix theory behaviour of black holes, and in clarifying the existence of the many-body localization phase in the thermodynamic limit. In this talk, I will give an overview on the generic behaviour of SFF in closed and open strongly-interacting many-body quantum chaotic systems, and the experimental measurements of SFF in quantum simulators.
