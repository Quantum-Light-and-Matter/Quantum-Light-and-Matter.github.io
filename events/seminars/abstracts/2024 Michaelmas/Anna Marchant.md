## Quantum sensors for Earth observation and fundamental physics

Atomic quantum sensors offer levels of accuracy and precision unmatched by their classical counterparts, opening up new possibilities in applications such as fundamental physics, navigation and Earth observation.  The sensitivity of atom interferometers to inertial forces makes them particularly well suited to Earth observation missions, with this sensitivity further enhanced by the extended free-fall times afforded by the low-gravity conditions in space.  On the ground, atom interferometers proposed for fundamental physics studies have the potential to detect distortions in space time produced by passing gravitational waves and to search for possible dark matter candidates, motivating the development of large-scale devices. 

In this talk I will discuss our current work at RAL Space developing quantum technology for these next generation sensors and their planned applications.
