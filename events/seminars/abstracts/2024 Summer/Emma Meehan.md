## Emma Meehan (Deep Science @ Boulby Underground Laboratory)

##  A journey to running the UK’s Deep Underground Laboratory

How does one go from being a self-employed Horse Riding Instructor to being Head of Operations in the UK’s Deep Underground Laboratory? Boulby underground Laboratory is 1.1km deep below ground in a working Salt and Polyhalite mine in the Northeast. Operating for over 20 years this lab is a special ‘quiet place’ in the universe for a multidisciplinary science programme and this talk is about my 15 year journey from being a self employed horse riding instructor with no scientific qualifications to becoming the Head of Operations responsible for the daily running of the laboratory and it’s staff.
